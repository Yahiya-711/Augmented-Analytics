        Please structure your report with the following sections, using markdown for formatting:

        ### 1. Executive Summary
        A brief, high-level overview of the most critical findings.

        ### 2. Key Statistical Findings
        - Describe the main characteristics of the numerical data (e.g., age, salary). Mention the average, median, and range.
        - Discuss the distribution of the categorical data (e.g., city).
        
        ### 3. Data Quality & Outliers
        - Point out any potential data quality issues based on the outlier detection. Mention which columns have outliers and what this might imply (e.g., data entry errors, or genuinely exceptional cases).

        ### 4. Actionable Business Insights
        - Based on all the information, provide 1-2 concrete insights that a business could act on. For example, "The significant salary outlier could represent a high-value client or a senior employee, warranting further investigation." or "The dominance of 'New York' in the city data suggests this is a key market."
